## valid XML
Adheres to basic structural requirements
Also adheres to content-specific specification
* Document Type Descriptor(DTD)
* XML Schema(XSD)

XML Document -> XML parser(DTD or XSD) -> parsed or invalid

## Document Type Descriptor (DTD)
* DTD is a Grammar-like language for specifying elements, attributes, nesting, ordering, #occurrences
* Also special attribute types ID and IDREF(S) (pointer with no type in XML)

### with DTD vs. without DTD
with DTD benefit (实际上是强类型的好处):
* programs can assume structure
* css/xsl
* specification - convinent for data exchanging
* documentation

without DTD benefit (弱类型好处):
* flexibility, ease of change
* DTDs can be messy

## XML Schema (XSD)
* extensive language
* like DTDs, can specify elements, attributes, nesting, ordering, #occurrences
* Also data types, keys, (typed) pointers and more
